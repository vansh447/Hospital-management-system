A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a software application designed to manage and automate various aspects of a hospital's operations. This includes patient records, staff management, appointment scheduling, and more. To create a basic HMS in Python, you can implement features like:

1. **Patient Management**: Add, view, and update patient information.
2. **Staff Management**: Add, view, and update staff (doctors, nurses, etc.) details.
3. **Appointments**: Schedule, cancel, and manage patient appointments with doctors.
4. **Billing and Payments**: Manage hospital billing and payments.
5. **Medical Records**: Track and store the medical history of patients.
- **Classes**:
  - `Patient`: Stores information about the patient.
  - `Doctor`: Stores information about the doctor.
  - `Appointment`: Stores appointment details for a patient and a doctor.
  - `HospitalManagementSystem`: Manages all patients, doctors, and appointments, including adding new records and displaying information.

- **Features**:
  - You can add patients and doctors.
  - You can schedule appointments.
  - You can view patient, doctor, and appointment details.
  
- **Menu-driven Interface**: Users interact with the system via a simple menu in the terminal, which allows for easy selection of different features.

### How to Use:
1. When you run the program, you'll be presented with a menu.
2. You can add patients, doctors, schedule appointments, and view details based on their IDs.
3. The program will keep running until you choose to exit.

This is a basic example and can be expanded with additional features such as:
- Billing management.
- Medical history tracking.
- Staff management.
- More complex data storage (using databases like SQLite or MySQL).
